## Post-work

If you wish to practice more on move semantics and resource management try to implement `shared_ptr`.
You can even try to make it thread safe ðŸ˜Š
You can reach me on Discord if you have any question or if you wish to have a code review.

## Post-test

Please [take this quiz](https://forms.gle/rhGWFrfsDQqbA3kL7) (10-15 min) about 2-5 days after the training.
It will help you recall this session and make it last a little bit longer in your memory.

## Evaluation
